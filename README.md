# SwordHammer
Repository for some SwordHammer Related Files. Main SwordHammer site is www.BeForgiven.INFO/SwordHammer

SwordHammer is presently in BETA stage of development. Note the main site above.

Of primary interest is the gpg/gpa/pgp public key for SwordHammer files with which the signatures of the files may be verified. This public key is also at the site above, but the copy here may be compared with the one on the site above, or also used to check the signatures of files. That way, an attacker would have to compromise two sites in order to inject malware into the SwordHammer files without signature verification failure.

Since it takes an account on github to access this site, at the present time, this site will see limited use.
